// RUNTIME passport of the accordion (`PWEB-37`, `PWEB-115`/`PWEB-118`, decomposed `PWEB-124`) —
// anatomy (`anatomy.ts`) plus everything else the running app needs: per-part STATES,
// the variant axis, and SETTINGS, tied together by `definePassport`.
//
// THIS FILE IS RUNTIME ONLY, same as the anatomy it builds on — it ships in the app bundle.
// Editor-facing metadata (`means`, group, genus, nesting/`accepts` rules, assembly templates)
// lives in `playground/index.ts` instead; that file depends on this one, never the other way.
//
// ## Why the accordion, and what it gives the mechanism
//
// On the button, half the assembly mechanism sat unproven: one part, no nesting, no ancestor, no
// repeats. Here everything is present at once — two levels of nesting, several nodes sharing one
// coordinate (many items, one address), an ancestor in a state (content looks different when its
// item is expanded), and a spot for composition (an item's trigger is a button).
//
// ## States were taken from a LIVE node, not from documentation
//
// Every state declared below was observed in markup (`accordion.test.tsx`). Two findings are
// worth naming:
//
//   • the TRIGGER's disabledness is expressed by the native `disabled`, not `data-disabled`: Zag
//     puts a real button attribute on the trigger, and puts `data-disabled` on the item, the
//     content, and the indicator instead. That is why the trigger declares the `:disabled`
//     pseudo-class — lying here with a `data-` attribute would hand the skin a dead rule;
//   • the item and the indicator express expansion with ONE vocabulary attribute,
//     `data-state="open"`, exactly as Zag's convention asks, but the CONTENT may not carry that
//     attribute at all when expanded — see below.
//
// ## The pilot's finding: the content's expansion mark does NOT always arrive
//
// Zag's collapsible assembles the item's content, and it drops `data-state` entirely whenever
// expansion happened WITHOUT animation: `skip = !initial && open`
// (`@zag-js/collapsible`, `connect`), and the `initial` flag is only raised by a genuinely
// animated expansion. So an item expanded from the very start carries neither `data-state="open"`
// nor any other expansion mark on its content.
//
// This "not always" is literal: after a real click, the mark arrives one way or another, and that
// was measured, not assumed. A test that expected a specific value from it after a click turned
// red on a repeat run — the unreliability reproduces, but does not reproduce RELIABLY, and cannot
// be asserted in a test (`accordion.test.tsx`). What is checked instead is the declaration, not an
// attempt to catch the mark at the right moment.
//
// **For the LOOK the conclusion stands and is not overturned:** a mark that may be absent cannot
// be an address — a skin rule keyed on it would silently fail to apply on exactly the items
// expanded by default. The expanded LOOK of the content is addressed through the ancestor instead:
// the `item` part holds expansion reliably, and the rule "content inside an expanded item" is
// expressed by the ancestor field that exists in the address for exactly this.
//
// **For MOTION the absence of a mark is the right answer, not a gap** (`PWEB-97`). The
// transition plays exactly when expansion is animated — and the mark arrives at exactly the same
// time; no mark, nothing to play. Had the passport stayed silent about the state entirely, motion
// would have had nothing to address the expanded content with, while the kit places the measured
// size (`--height`) right there too, without which the animation cannot exist. That would leave
// half the mechanism declared and the other half unsaid.
//
// So the state IS DECLARED, and the mark's unreliability is named machine-readably — the
// `absentWhen` field (the form — `@web-core/skin/model`, `PWEB-110`). A reader working
// for the LOOK drops such states itself (`addressesView`, and through it `coordinateOf`); a reader
// working for MOTION reads them together with the circumstance. The passport's former silence
// decided this for both readers at once and was indistinguishable from "the provider did not look".
