// EDITOR-ONLY metadata for the timer. Human-facing text, taxonomy, and nesting rules for the
// visual editor and for agents reading the catalog — never for the running app. Same split as
// every other component: `defineEditorInfo` depends one-way on `passport` (the runtime contract
// in `../entity/passport.ts`), and nothing flows back, so a production bundle that never imports
// `/editor` never pays for a single word written below.
//
// THIN on purpose, the same physical shape as every other component's `playground/` (`PWEB-127`):
// taxonomy (`parts.ts`) and scenario data (`assemblies.ts`) live in their own files. No
// `settings.ts` — the timer has no setting from the closed vocabulary (`../entity/passport.ts`).
//
// `genus`/`group` are real classifications, not prose: a plain component (`genus: "component"`);
// `group` is `other`, the same open question the tabs'/table's/dialog's own comment already names
// (`PWEB-34`) — a timer is not `disclosure` and no better-fitting section exists yet. `footprint`
// is real too (`footprintOf`, `PWEB-31`): `"compact"` — a handful of digits and a couple of
// buttons, the same small-atom bracket the icon/checkbox already sit in.
