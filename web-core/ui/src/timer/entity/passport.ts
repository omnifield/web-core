// RUNTIME passport of the timer — anatomy (`anatomy.ts`) plus everything else the running app
// needs: per-part STATES, tied together by `definePassport`.
//
// THIS FILE IS RUNTIME ONLY, same as the anatomy it builds on — it ships in the app bundle.
// Editor-facing metadata lives in `playground/index.ts` instead; that file depends on this one,
// never the other way.
//
// Every mark below was read from `@zag-js/timer/timer.connect.mjs` (109 lines, read in full),
// the same rigor the rest of the kit's passports read from a `.connect.mjs`.
//
// ## `running`/`paused` are NEVER written as a `data-*` attribute anywhere in this connector
//
// The API returns `running`/`paused` as plain booleans (`connect`'s own return value), but NOT
// ONE `getXxxProps` function spreads either onto any part — checked across all eight. A skin
// cannot key a rule on "the timer is running" through any attribute at all; the only externally
// visible trace is `actionTrigger`'s own native `hidden` (which action buttons show/hide), and
// that has no substitute address either — the same honest absence the file upload's own
// `clearTrigger` already names, not invented here to fill a gap.
//
// ## `root`/`area`/`control`/`separator` carry NO marks of any kind
//
// `getRootProps`/`getAreaProps`/`getControlProps`/`getSeparatorProps` set only `id`/`role`/
// `aria-*`/the anatomy address itself — no `data-*` anywhere. Four of the eight parts are simply
// bare, a checkable fact, not a placeholder.
//
// ## `item` carries a real, measured `--value` — the raw number behind the formatted text
//
// `getItemProps` sets `style: { "--value": value }` where `value = time[props.type]` — the actual
// numeric count for that time unit (e.g. `42` for seconds), not a position/size hint the way
// every other kit component's own variables have been. A skin can read it for a counter-style or
// clip-path effect; declared the same way any other kit-written custom property is.
//
// ## `item`/`itemLabel`/`itemValue` share ONE five-valued `data-type` — which time unit this is
//
// `TimePart` (`@zag-js/timer/timer.types.d.mts`) is exactly `"days"|"hours"|"minutes"|"seconds"|
// "milliseconds"` — checked against the actual interface, not guessed from the common four-part
// case. The same "one shared attribute, several real values" shape the date picker's own `view`
// and the menu's own item `type` already use.
//
// ## `actionTrigger` is a genuine button with no JS-tracked pointer state
//
// `getActionTriggerProps` sets no `data-*` mark of its own at all (only the native `hidden`
// above) — `hover`/`focus-visible`/`active` are the only addressable facts it has, the plain
// button's own reasoning.
